## üîê Step 3: Get Refresh Token

```
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chromewebstore&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&access_type=offline
```

### 3.2 Get Authorization Code
1. Authorize the application
2. Copy the authorization code from the browser

### 3.3 Exchange for Refresh Token
Run this curl command (replace ALL_CAPS placeholders):

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  -d "redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob" \
  -d "access_type=offline" \
  https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues During Setup

#### Extension ID Not Found
- **Problem**: Extension wasn't uploaded to Chrome Web Store yet
- **Solution**: Complete Step 1 first

#### Invalid OAuth Credentials  
- **Problem**: Wrong client_id or client_secret
- **Solution**: Re-download OAuth credentials JSON file

#### Refresh Token Expired
- **Problem**: `invalid_grant` error
- **Solution**: Regenerate refresh token using Step 3

#### Chrome Web Store API Not Enabled
- **Problem**: API access denied
- **Solution**: Enable Chrome Web Store API in Google Cloud Console

#### Extension Rejected
